# Directory System

The project consists of 2 main directories that are:
 - backend
 - frontend

backend-folder consists of the APIs written in the elixir-language, and frontend-folder consists of the web-ui written in the react-language.

  * Move to the backend-folder via `cd backend`
  * Run `mix deps.get` to get the dependencies
  * Run `mix ecto.create` to create the database
  * Start Phoenix server with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
